## All About Me
***Knew blog***

***By Lewis Caroll (1865)***
All in the Golden Afternoon

All in the Golden Afternoon
Full leisurely we glide;
For both  our oars, with littel skill,
By little arms are plied,
While little hands make vain pretense our wanderingsto guide.
Ah cruel Three!in such an hour,Beneath such dreamy weather,
To stir the tiniest feather!
Yet what can one poor voice avail
gainst three tongues together?
Imperious Prima flashes forth Her edict to "begin it":
In gentler tones Secunda hopes
"There wil be nonsensein it."
While Tertia interrupts the tale
Not more then once a minute.
Anon, to sudden silence won,
in fancy they pursue
The dream-child moving through a land
Of wonders wild and new, in frindly chat with bird or beast-- And half believe it true.
And ever, as the story drained 
The wells of fancy dry,
And faintly strove that weary one To put the subject by,
