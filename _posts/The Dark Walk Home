I want to follow this advice and strive to create something I care about.

Let me tell you the story of Lucy Spring. 
She used to love it here. It was so vibrant. So colorful. 
Things have changed. She left Mayview City two years ago, with no plans of ever returning. 
Death has a way of bringing people home.
She had hoped the familiar sidewalks would comfort her in a way the funeral visitors couldn’t. Instead, they made her uneasy. 
She has a long walk to her car, wit ha phone as dead as her little brother.
Why hadn’t she called Bekki? She would have liked to hear her voice. What Lucy is hearing now isn’t a voice. Lucy stops. 
The footsteps don’t.
