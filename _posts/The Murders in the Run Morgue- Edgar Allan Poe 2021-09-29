Hailed as the “Father of Modern Short Stories”, did you know that Edgar Allan Poe is also the father of detective stories?  
The short story “Murders in the Rue Morgue” is the first detective fiction story that paved the way for other writers to follow.  

If Dupin reads like a familiar character, just know that his traits have been adopted by many other fictional detectives, 
Including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie’s Hercule Poirot. 
It is a very short story but a classic nonetheless.
